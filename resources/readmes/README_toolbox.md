## 📍 Installation Location

## 🚀 Launching Toolbox

```

### After First Launch
JetBrains Toolbox will:
- Add itself to your system's application menu
- Run in the background and appear in your system tray
- Auto-update itself when new versions are available

## 🛠️ Using Toolbox

Once launched, JetBrains Toolbox allows you to:
1. **Install IDEs**: IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, CLion, etc.

## 🔄 Updating

JetBrains Toolbox auto-updates itself. However, if you need to reinstall:
```bash
cd ~/git/${USER}/github/mylicula
./install.sh
# Select: "3rd party apps: Toolbox"
```

MyLiCuLa will detect if the latest version is already installed and skip if up-to-date.

## 💡 Important Notes

- Toolbox is installed per-user (not system-wide)
- The application auto-updates itself
- IDEs installed through Toolbox are stored in `~/.local/share/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/`
- Toolbox settings are stored in `~/.local/share/JetBrains/Toolbox/`

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Toolbox not appearing in system tray
Try launching it manually from the installation directory:
```bash
cd ~/development/jetbrains-toolbox/jetbrains-toolbox-*/
./jetbrains-toolbox &
```

### Finding your installation
```bash
ls -la ~/development/jetbrains-toolbox/
```
